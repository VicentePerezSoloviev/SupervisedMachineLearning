# SupervisedMachineLearning
 Materials for the "Miner√≠a de datos" subject in the UPM.
 
 Python:
 - Feature Subset Selection. Filter and Wrapper approaches.
 - KNN. 
 - Logistic Regression. Some interesting plots are provided.
 - Naive Bayes.
 
 R:
 - Naive Bayes and Tree-augmented Naive Bayes. Using bnlearn
 - Logistic regression.
 - KNN.
 - Feature Subset selection. Filter and Wrapper approaches.

 WEKA:
 - Some .arff datasets for explanation.
 
 The students are then expected to find a dataset and apply all the classification models learnt in the lessonss and perform a comparative of the behaviour of this algorithms. 
 
 To transform CSV datasets to .arff files you can use several webpages or python scripts. Here is one of them: https://ikuz.eu/csv2arff/
